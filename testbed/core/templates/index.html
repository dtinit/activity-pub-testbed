  <h1>ActivityPub Account Portability Testbed</h1>
  <br />
  <p>
    The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> account portability testbed is an implementation of <a href="https://swicg.github.io/activitypub-data-portability/lola.html">LOLA</a>, a proposal for an interoperable approach to moving accounts between ActivityPub servers.  The testbed implements LOLA as a source server currently, and we have plans to implement LOLA as a destination as well.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    If you are building a LOLA implementation, register for a test account here (coming soon).  The account will be populated with test data including posts, follows and item history.  Use this account to test moving an ActivityPub Actorâ€™s full account to your site.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Accounts on this site are not full ActivityPub accounts in that they are not shared to the Fediverse or truly federated with other ActivityPubservers.
